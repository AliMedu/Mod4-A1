Two folders included:
---------------------
_SortedIntegers - Compiled - Javadoc Included: this folder includes the compiled version with the javadoc files

SortedIntegers: This folder only includes the program Java files, which must be compiled first, and javadoc needs to be generated. I have tested Using the following command in the next section.

Instructions - to be used from inside the folder 'SortedIntegers' or the other folder if only running the program:
----------------------------
To create the javadoc files from the command:
javadoc edu/merrimack/sorting/SortedIntegers.java

To compile the Java file, use the command:
javac edu/merrimack/sorting/SortedIntegers.java

A new file, SortedIntegers.class, will be created in the same directory as the Java file.

To run the program, use the command:
java edu.merrimack.sorting.SortedIntegers
